# From http://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile/183980#183980
# ~/.bashrc is the place to put stuff that applies only to bash itself,
# such as alias and function definitions, shell options, and prompt settings.
# (You could also put key bindings there, but for bash they normally go into
#  ~/.inputrc.)
export PATH=~/dotfiles/bin:$PATH

if [ -f .bashrc.`hostname` ]; then
	source .bashrc.`hostname`
