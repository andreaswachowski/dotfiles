# From http://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile/183980#183980 :
#
# ~/.bashrc is the place to put stuff that applies only to bash itself,
# such as alias and function definitions, shell options, and prompt settings.
# (You could also put key bindings there, but for bash they normally go into
#  ~/.inputrc.)

# Careful: bashrc might be sourced for non-interactive shells, in
# particular scp, see
# http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2012-06/msg00028.html
# scp breaks when it encounters output, so all echos etc. must be
# avoided, and explicitly only happen when in interactive mode
